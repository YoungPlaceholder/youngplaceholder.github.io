# Physics Calculator

This is a simple physics calculator application that allows users to perform various physics calculations. It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for input and displays the results on the screen.

## Getting Started

To run the application, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
2. Download or clone the source code from the repository.
3. Open the project in your preferred Java development environment.
4. Build and run the `Main.java` file.

## Usage

Upon launching the application, a GUI window will appear with a menu panel on the left and a result panel in the center.

The menu panel contains buttons for different physics calculations, including:

- Max Height: Calculates the maximum height of an object given the initial speed.
- Final Velocity: Calculates the final velocity of an object given the initial velocity.
- Displacement: Calculates the displacement of an object given the initial velocity.
- Angular Velocity: Calculates the angular velocity of an object given the radius and linear velocity.

To perform a calculation, follow these steps:

1. Click on the corresponding button for the desired calculation.
2. Enter the required input values in the dialog box that appears.
3. Click "OK" to perform the calculation.

The result will be displayed in the result panel at the center of the window.
